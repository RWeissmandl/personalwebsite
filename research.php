                <p class='intro'>
                My area of research interest lies in student voice in primary education. I am particularly interested in how mainstream education 
                can grant students choice in what and how they learn. My most recent research, a Master dissertation for the
                University of Cambridge considers this from the perspectives of parents and young people attending self-directed or democratic
                settings. It explores the question philosophically, drawing on UNCRC's Article 3 vs Article 12, perspectives of childhood, 
                and its relationship with how children learn. I am also focussed on research methodology and how it relates to 
                epistemological and ontological viewpoints.
                I am open for oppertunities for collaberative research in this and all matters surrounding education.
