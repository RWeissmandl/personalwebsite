This Python code connects to Strava and pulls the latest activities. I use the Requests library to connect to Strava as a popular Python library. Other options include Strava's Python library Stravalib. Strava uses OAuth2 for authentication. Once a one-time refresh token is gained (for more info: https://developers.strava.com/docs/getting-started/), a short-lived access-token can be aquired. Each time an access token is gained, there is the chance that the refresh token may update, with only the latest refresh token valid. Therefore, I store all tokens in a PostgreSQL database using the psycopg2 library to connect. A next step is to move identification details to a .gitignore file.
