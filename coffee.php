                <p class='intro'>
                I attribute my successes to coffee, indeed, "I run on coffee and insulin". 
                I became more invested in coffee when I realised that it would be cheaper to buy a machine and learn how to make
                good coffee at home. At that point, my definition of good was still Starbucks, and I was buying a coffee there
                each day on the way to work (and sometimes on its return). And thus, coffee became more than simply a drink,
                but a hobby. These days, I find independent cafes wherever I can, and take pride in reviewing them. 
                </br></br>
                <b> Coming soon: </b> I am now working on setting up a page for these reviews. 
                In the meantime, here is my own little home coffee setup.
